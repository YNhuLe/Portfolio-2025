        I'm a motivated and creative Computer Systems Technology student from
        Sheridan College and BrainStation, with over 3 years of experience in
        customer-facing roles and fast-paced environments. I have a passion for
        building thingsâ€”whether it's coding up a new idea, designing something
        beautiful, or diving into DIY projects. I love exploring the
        intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm always excited to
        connect with others to share ideas, learn, and grow together.
